leds-parport
============

For a homebrew router project I was looking for a way to visualize system status (load, HD access) and network activity. The board offers a good old parallel port, so I decided to use that one. This driver hooks into the Linux `leds` framework and provides 12 LED output pins (8 on the data port and 4 on the control port) that can be used with all the nice LED triggers (`heartbeat`, `netdev` etc) the Linux kernel offers. The LED names (under `/sys/class/leds/parport:`) should be self-explanatory and correspond directly to the parallel port pin names.

Installation
------------

This repo contains a simple `Makefile` to compile the module and is also prepared for a Debian DKMS `.deb`. The latter can be generated by running `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b`.
